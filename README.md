This repository contains some of my data science projects. The readme file of each folder includes a summary of the project as well as
the links to the report and presentation of the project in Google Drive. The folders also include all the Python codes of the projects.

So far I have uploaded two projects:
1) Predicting loan status at Lending Club
2) Impact of multiple variables on poverty of US counties
