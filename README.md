This repository contains some of my data science projects. The readme file of each project includes a summary of the project as well as
the links to the report and presentation of the project in Google Drive. The folder of each project also includes all the Python codes.

So far I have uploaded two projects:
1) Predicting loan status at Lending Club
2) Impact of multiple variables on poverty of US counties
